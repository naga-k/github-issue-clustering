53,Issue 2: Unnecessary 3-Second Delay on All Actions,"**Description:**
There is a forced 3-second delay (simulated loading state) applied to critical user actions such as applying a coupon and processing payment. This degrades the user experience and makes the application feel unresponsive.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1.  Click the ""Apply"" button for a coupon OR click ""Pay Now"".
2.  Observe the ""Verifying..."" or ""Processing..."" loading overlay.
3.  Time the duration of the overlay.

**Expected Behavior:**
Actions should complete as quickly as the system allows, without artificial delays.

**Actual Behavior:**
Every action is blocked by a 3-second timer before executing.",ux_latency
54,"Coupon Code ""SAVE20"" Increases Price Instead of Discounting","Description:
When a user applies the coupon code ""SAVE20"", the expectation is a 20% discount on the total price. However, the current implementation multiplies the total by 1.2, effectively increasing the price by 20%.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the checkout page.
Enter ""SAVE20"" in the Discount Code field.
Click the ""Apply"" button.
Observe the ""Total Due"" amount.
Expected Behavior:
The total price should decrease by 20%.

Actual Behavior:
The total price increases by 20%.",coupon_bug
